### 2014 - 2017

Teaching assistant, department of Electronics and Signal Processing, <a href="http://www.enseeiht.fr/en/index.html">INP-ENSEEIHT</a>, Toulouse, France.

- **Responsibilities**: Supervision of practical sessions and projects (first and last year engineering students, equivalent to L3 and M2 level).  
- **Fields**: *Digital filtering*, *audio signal processing*, *algorithm implementation on <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Blackfin</span> DSPs*.  
- **Full description**:  
  - **Digital signal processing project (M2 students) [45h]**: *Projects devoted to the study of several topics in digital signal processing, based on research articles from the literature. Examples of proposed projects include the study of quantization effects on filter synthesis, the study of optimal filter synthesis (e.g., eigenfilter), or the implementation of interpolated FIR filters with a comparative analysis of their computational and memory cost.*  
  - **Practical sessions in digital signal processing (L3 students) [52.5h]**: *Introduction to digital signal processing given to first year engineering students in electronics, focused on digital filter synthesis techniques (FIR and IIR filters, filter synthesis, windowing, stability...).*  
  - **Programming digital signal processors (DSP) (M2 students) [94.5h]**: *Practical sessions and project devoted to the implementation of audio effects (flanger, chorus, equalization, fade-in/out, filtering) on an <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Analog Device Blackfin</span> (ADSP-BF533) DSP, with a fixed-point precision architecture. Algorithm development is conducted in C and assembly language.*
